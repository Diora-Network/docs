# Use Cases

## DIR Token
Dioraâ€™s native token is not just a fee and staking token. Rather, it will be the one the first tokens on an EVM that drives governance outcomes for the EVM. But it also serves as a vehicle to determine future economic outcomes that align the three main actors (Developers, Users, and Validators).

## Decentralized / Open Finance
Diora relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Masternode (PoSM) consensus that can support low transaction fees and 6 second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes.
With our current core products DioraMaster, DioraScan, DeFiMask, Token Bridge mixed with our future DeFi Products, Algorithmic stable coin, P2P lending market, prediction market, ICO template, STO Platform, DeFiSwap, liquid token lending market, and other financial derivative products we strongly believe that Diora is the best blockchain for Decentralized / Open Finance products.

## EVM Compatible
Diora supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers meaning any Ethereum Dapp can easily be migrated to Diora. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelization, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into Diora's Masternode architecture. It will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuance's and token integrations for small and big businesses.

## Gaming Networks
Historically, games have been run by companies who control the supply and sale of in-game currencies as well as digital assets and collectibles.
Users do not own the assets they buy or win on traditional gaming platforms. Blockchain offers us a credible way of users taking control of their assets for ownership and trade.
Diora can help increase the efficiency of performing transactions of gaming networks over a blockchain. Transactions such as buying or selling in-game currencies and buying and digital assets can be significantly sped up. 

## Payments
Integrate DeFi Payments on your Dapps with a few simple steps. Settle payments on-chain whenever needed.
Payment transactions on Diora can be confirmed in sub-seconds due to faster block generation times while incurring significantly lower fees. Make payments smoother and friction-free for users on your Dapps.
Diora provides payment APIs/SDKs for Dapps, merchant, and users to instantly accept or pay in crypto assets like ERC20 tokens.

## Lending & Credit scoring platform (DID)
Diora will enable a platform for merchants to assess the creditworthiness of connected users via their transaction history. This enables merchants to lend tokens to users on the network when transacting with users that do not have sufficient funds.

## Identity
Decentralized apps need a way to sign transactions, but that must happen without submitting private keys on each Dapp. Through an Open-Identity system, Diora makes sure users have control over their private keys without worrying about their security.

## Trustless Bridges
Diora smart contracts will allow users to pay with any crypto token they prefer and receiver will receive payment in assets they prefer.  Automatically handles the conversion through atomic swaps between cross-chain crypto assets.

## Decentralized Exchange
