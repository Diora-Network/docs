# Double validation 

Double validation provides an additional trustless validation layer for security enhancement through a provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization.


Specifically, when a block is created by a masternode, it must be verified by another masternode that is randomly selected among the set of masternodes before being added to the blockchain.


Double validation strengthens Dioraâ€™s security, reduces fork and nothing at stake attacks, and makes Diora unique among other Proof of stake based blockchains.
