# Double validation 

Double validation provides an additional trustless validation layer for security enhancement through a provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization.


Specifically, when a block is created by a masternode, it must be verified by another masternode that is randomly selected among the set of masternodes before being added to the blockchain.


Double validation strengthens Diora’s security, reduces fork and nothing at stake attacks, and makes Diora unique among other Proof of stake based blockchains.
